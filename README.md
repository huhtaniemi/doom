This project is a coding exercise focused on porting Python code to C#. It is based on the "Coder Space" channel's demo of a Doom port. The goal is to practice translating logic, structures, and algorithms between languages while maintaining functionality. The project serves as a learning experience in code adaptation and performance optimization.
